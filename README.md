The above project is a Python implementation of the popular Tic Tac
Toe game using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.
The game features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking
X's and O's in the grid until one of the players wins by placing three
marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw if no
player wins. The game also includes a "Play Again" button that resets
the game board and allows the players to play again. The game's
functionality is implemented through various methods in a class
called TicTacToe, which is initialized with the Tkinter window and
creates the game board and buttons through its create_board
method. The game's state and logic are maintained through instance
variables and methods like button_click, change_turn,
check_win, check_draw, and show_message. When the game
is over, a pop-up window is displayed showing the winner or a draw
message, along with a "Play Again" button that resets the game board
and destroys the pop-up window
